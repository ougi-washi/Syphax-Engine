# Docs Style Guide

- Use direct, concrete language.
- Keep commands copy-ready.
- Define terms on first use and link to glossary.
- Use exact API symbol names from headers.
- Avoid ambiguous link text.

## Naming rules

- Use repository-relative paths in code blocks.
- Use exact build target names from `examples/*.c` and `examples/advanced/*.c`.

## Callout usage

```markdown
!!! tip "Tip"
    Use when sharing practical shortcuts.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Use for risky actions.

!!! warning "Common mistake"
    Use for repeat errors and include clear correction steps.
```
